    "changelog": "### Fixed\n- Fixed a potential memory corruption issue on Rift when calculating mirror view rects\n- Issue where enabling mobile Depth Submission could cause crashes on application startup if MSAA was disabled. The problem was fixed in Unity 2020.3 and above. To get the fix, install the latest patch release of whichever Unity version you are using\n- Resolved an issue where disconnecting a Link device then reconnecting it could result in a black screen with no input\n- Resolved a potential issue where read-only System Splash Screen images could cause build failures\n- Fixed a potential startup crash on Quest when app initialization is interrupted and then resumed\n\n### Known Issues\n- `Unity.XR.Oculus.Stats.PerfMetrics` entries currently return `0` when using the OpenXR runtime, which is the default in the 2.x and 3.x versions of the Oculus XR Plugin package\n- `Unity.XR.Oculus.Stats.AppMetrics` entries currently return `0` on all Oculus runtimes\n- For both of the above, the suggested replacement is to use the profiling tools available via the Oculus Developer Hub: https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/ts-odh-logs-metrics/\n- Enabling mobile Depth Submission may cause crashes on application startup if MSAA is disabled. Enabling MSAA will resolve the issue. This will be resolved in future versions of Unity"
